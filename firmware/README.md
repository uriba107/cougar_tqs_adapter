## NOTE
two hex files are supplied.
**please use the LUFA_VID version, as it is using publicly available VID/PID combo.**

however, for debugging purposes only, I've also added a version compiled to use Thrustmaster Vendor ID and a made up PID.
As TM are the owners of the VID, this is **NOT** to be used for any other purpose other then debugging.

If code is distributed in ANY way, especially if you plan to do anything remotly commercial make sure you use the LUFA VID version.
